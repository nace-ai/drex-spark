# Contributing

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nace-ai/drex-spark/issues) for bugs and proposals. Include the integration version,
runtime version, expected behavior and a small reproduction with synthetic inputs. Never include credentials,
signed image URLs or customer data.

## Local checks

Clone the repository and follow [Development](README.md#development) from the repository root.
The default tests use a local mock API, and the Spark tests need Java 17; a passing mock test is not a check
against the live API or a Databricks workspace. See [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) for the CI commands.

Live tests require separate credentials and may incur API and cloud charges. Do not run them as part of a routine
documentation change. Describe any skipped checks in the pull request.

## Pull requests

Keep the change focused, explain the behavior it changes and list the checks you actually ran. Update the
[API reference](docs/API.md) and examples if an interface changes. Preserve NULL/error semantics, credential
handling and request-cost warnings. Use synthetic fixtures and avoid committing generated bundles or local secrets.
